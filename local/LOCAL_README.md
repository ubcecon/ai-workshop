## Running Locally

These are the notebook files to run locally, on your own PC.  You should use either RStudio or VSCode with the Quarto extension to run them.

* You will need to have installed the relevant packages and software on your own computer before your can run them.
* You should also pay attention to the *directory* where the files are.
  * For most system set-ups, you should be able to move these in the `ai-workshop` directory (one above this folder) and all of the files should load.
  * However, this is _specific_ to your computer system.
