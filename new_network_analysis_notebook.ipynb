For example, in a social network, a cluster might represent a group of people who frequently interact with each other but have fewer interactions with people outside the group. **Community detection** is the process of finding such communities within nodes. \n",

Mathematically, modularity compares the observed density of edges within a community to the expected density of edges if the connections were random. A positive modularity value suggests a strong community structure, while values closer to zero or negative indicate that the divisions are no better than random.\n",

In the second phase, the algorithm creates a new network where each community from the first phase is treated as a single node, and the process is repeated. This hierarchical approach continues until no further modularity improvements can be made, resulting in a final set of communities that maximize modularity. "
