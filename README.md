# UBC Social Sciences and the Humanities AI and Machine Learning Workshops

These notebooks have been jointly developed by the [Centre for Computational Social Science](https://ccss.arts.ubc.ca/) and the [Vancouver School of Economics'](https://economics.ubc.ca/) [COMET Team](https://comet.arts.ubc.ca/) to faculty, students, and staff learning how AI tools can be used _in_ the discipline, to develop new and innovative lines of research.

As the number of these workshops has expanded, we have moved the content to specific branches of this repository:

* [`querying_ai_2023`](https://github.com/ubcecon/ai-workshop/tree/querying_ai_2023): this branch contains our materials demonstrating word embeddings for the conference "Querying AI: Working with AI for Humanities and Social Science Research" which was held at UBC in October 2023. 
* [`ccss_2024`](https://github.com/ubcecon/ai-workshop/tree/ccss-2024): this branch contains materials for the 2024 workshop on word embeddings, featuring updated versions of the notebooks above.
