# CCSS - LLMs Workshop
> Working with AI for Humanities and Social Science Research: Python and R for Word Embeddings and Language Models
> UBC, September 2024

Welcome to our repository for our using LLMs via the API.  To make this workshop more accessible to participants, we have two options available for hands-on participation.

## Options for Using these Notebooks

There are two options in the workshop to code along with us during the session:

1.  Use them via [Google Colab](https://colab.google/), again in your web-browser.  This option requires a Google Account.
2.  Use them locally (on your computer).

### Option 1: Google Colab

This is also straightforward.  To do this, click this link:

<https://colab.research.google.com/github/ubcecon/ai-workshop/blob/ccss-2024/>

And log-in with your Google Account:

* Select the version `advanced_llm_apis2_colab.ipynb` which is designed for Google Colab.
* Make sure you follow the instructions to install `xterm` and `ollama` on the server.

### Option 2: Run Locally

The other option is the most complex, but the notebooks can be run locally on your hardware.

* Before you get started, download and install: [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/), [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/install), and [`ollama`](https://ollama.com/download)
* Next, download and extract the workshop files at this link: 
* Launch Jupyter, and open the notebook.
